I would firstly like to thank the members of my jury.
My examiners, Vivien Qu\'ema and Gilles Muller were generous with their 
comments on my thesis, and I value their assessment and input to its improvement.
Thanks are also due to Isabelle Puaut for her feedback and for agreeing
to preside over my jury.
I was grateful for the insight of their feedback and questions.

I would also like to thank the members of the DiverSE Team.
The opportunity of meeting researches who come from amazingly different places is
what I appreciate the most about the last three years.
It still shocks me how we share a vision despite of our differences.
I would love to believe that listening all the scientific discussions has positively transformed
who I am. 

Finally, special thanks are due to my advisers, Olivier Barais and Johann Bourcier.
First, for their useful advices, and second for offering me the opportunity of working
with them; it has been -- for many good reasons -- an interesting and wonderful experience.
