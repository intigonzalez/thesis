%Resource management is critical to guarantee Quality of Service when various stakeholders share the execution environment, such as cloud or mobile environments.
%In this context, providing management techniques compatible with standard practices, such as component models, is essential.
%Resource management is often realized through monitoring techniques, while resource isolation uses virtual machines or containers (e.g., docker).
%These techniques (i) impose varying levels of overhead depending on the managed resource, and (ii) are applied at different abstraction levels, such as processes, threads or objects.
%Thus, mapping components to system-level abstractions in the presence of resource management requirements can lead to sub-optimal systems.
%
%We propose Squirrel, an approach to tune component deployment and resource management in order to reduce management overhead.
%At runtime, Squirrel uses an architectural model annotated with resource requirements to guide the mapping of components to system abstractions, providing different resource management capabilities and overhead.
%We present an implementation of Squirrel, using a Java component framework,
%and a set of experiments to validate its feasibility and overhead.
%We show that choosing the right \textit{component-to-system} mappings at deployment-time reduces performance overhead and/or memory use.
