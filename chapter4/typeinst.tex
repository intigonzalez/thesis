\begin{abstract}
Resource management is critical to guarantee Quality of Service when various stakeholders share the execution environment, such as cloud or mobile environments.
In this context, providing management techniques compatible with standard practices, such as component models, is essential.
Resource management is often realized through monitoring techniques, while resource isolation uses virtual machines or containers (e.g., docker).
These techniques (i) impose varying levels of overhead depending on the managed resource, and (ii) are applied at different abstraction levels, such as processes, threads or objects.
Thus, mapping components to system-level abstractions in the presence of resource management requirements can lead to sub-optimal systems.

%We propose Squirrel, an approach to automatically tune component deployment and resource management in order to maintain a good balance between management overhead and the level of sharing.
We propose Squirrel, an approach to tune component deployment and resource management in order to reduce management overhead.
%In Squirrel, an architectural model annotated with resource requirements is used at runtime to guide the mapping of components to system abstractions with different resource management capabilities and overhead.
At runtime, Squirrel uses an architectural model annotated with resource requirements to guide the mapping of components to system abstractions, providing different resource management capabilities and overhead.
%To evaluate the approach, 
We present an implementation of Squirrel, using a Java component framework,
%for a Java-based component platform
and a set of experiments to validate its feasibility and overhead.
%\hl{The results show how the right mapping selection can reduce the performance impact and memory footprint.[NEEDS IMPROVEMENT]}
We show that choosing the right \textit{component-to-system} mappings at deployment-time reduces performance overhead and/or memory use.
%The results show (i) better performance than system deployed with full isolation among components and, (ii) only memory overhead in certain situations when comparing an application against its version running without resource management.
