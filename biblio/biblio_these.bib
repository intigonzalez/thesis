    abstract = {{Most consumer electronics today contain embedded software. In the early days, developing CE software presented relatively minor challenges, but in the past several years three significant problems have arisen: size and complexity of the software in individual products; the increasing diversity of products and their software; and the need for decreased development time.The question of handling diversity and complexity in embedded software at an increasing production speed becomes an urgent one. The authors present their belief that the answer lies not in hiring more software engineers. They are not readily available, and even if they were, experience shows that larger projects induce larger lead times and often result in greater complexity. Instead, they believe that the answer lies in the use and reuse of software components that work within an explicit software architecture.The Koala model, a component-oriented approach detailed in this article, is their way of handling the diversity of software in consumer electronics. Used for embedded software in TV sets, it allows late binding of reusable components with no additional overhead.}},

The OSGi framework is a Java-based, centralized, component oriented
platform. It is being widely adopted as an execution environment for
the development of extensible applications. However, current Java
Virtual Machines are unable to isolate components from each other. For
instance, a malicious component can freeze the complete platform by
allocating too much memory or alter the behavior of other components
by modifying shared variables.  This paper presents I-JVM, a Java
Virtual Machine that provides a lightweight approach to isolation
while preserving compatibility with legacy OSGi applications. Our
evaluation of I-JVM shows that it solves the 8 known OSGi
vulnerabilities that are due to the Java Virtual Machine and that the
overhead of I-JVM compared to the JVM on which it is based is below
20\%.

   In the last few years, managed runtime environments such as the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) 
	 are increasingly used on large-scale multicore servers. The garbage collector (GC) represents 
	 a critical component of the JVM and has a significant influence on the overall performance and 
	 efficiency of the running application. We perform a study on all available Java GCs, both in 
	 an academic environment (set of benchmarks), as well as in a simulated real-life situation
	 (client-server application). We mainly focus on the three most widely
	 used collectors: ParallelOld, ConcurrentMarkSweep and G1. We find that
	 they exhibit different behaviours in the two tested environments. In
	 particular, the default Java GC, ParallelOld, proves to be stable and
	 adequate in the first situation, while in the real-life scenario its
	 use results in unacceptable pauses for the application threads. We believe 
	 that this is partly due to the memory requirements of the
	 multicore server. G1 GC performs notably bad on the benchmarks when
	 forced to have a full collection between the iterations of the
	 application. Moreover, even though G1 and ConcurrentMarkSweep GCs
	 introduce significantly lower pauses than ParallelOld in the
	 client-server environment, they can still seriously impact the
	 response time on the client. Pauses of around 3 seconds can make a
	 real-time system unusable and may disrupt the communication between
	 nodes in the case of large-scale distributed systems.

  On contemporary cache-coherent Non-Uniform Memory Access
  (ccNUMA) architectures, applications with a large memory footprint
  suffer from the cost of the garbage collector (GC), because,
  as the GC scans the reference graph, it makes many remote memory
  accesses, saturating the interconnect between memory nodes.
  We address this problem with NumaGiC, a GC with a
  mostly-distributed design.
  In order to maximise memory access locality during collection, a GC
  thread avoids accessing a different memory node, instead notifying a
  remote GC thread with a message; nonetheless, NumaGiC avoids the
  drawbacks of a pure distributed design, which tends to decrease
  parallelism.
  We compare NumaGiC with Parallel Scavenge and NAPS
  on two different ccNUMA architectures running on the Hotspot Java Virtual Machine of OpenJDK 7.
  On Spark and Neo4j, two industry-strength analytics applications,
  with heap sizes ranging from 160\,GB to 350\,GB, and on
  SPECjbb2013 and SPECjbb2005, NumaGiC improves
  overall performance by up to 45\% over NAPS
  (up to 94\% over Parallel Scavenge),
  and increases the performance of
  the collector itself by up to 3.6$\times$ over NAPS
  (up to 5.4$\times$ over Parallel Scavenge).

Today, Java is regularly used to implement large multi-threaded
server-class applications that use locks to protect access to shared data. However, understanding the
impact of locks on the performance of a system is complex, and thus the use of locks can impede the
progress of threads on configurations that were not anticipated by the developer, during specific
phases of the execution. In this paper, we propose Free Lunch, a new lock profiler for Java application
servers, specifically designed to identify, in-vivo, phases where the progress of the threads is impeded
by a lock. Free Lunch is designed around a new metric, critical section pressure (CSP), which
directly correlates the progress of the threads to each of the locks. Using Free Lunch, we have
identified phases of high CSP, which were hidden with other lock profilers, in the distributed
Cassandra NoSQL database and in several applications from the DaCapo 9.12, the SPECjvm2008 and the
SPECjbb2005 benchmark suites. Our evaluation of Free Lunch shows that its overhead is never greater
than 6\%, making it suitable for in-vivo use.

In August 2011, Linux entered its third decade. Ten years before, Chou
et al. published a study of faults found by applying
a static analyzer to Linux versions 1.0 through
2.4.1. A major result of their work was that the
drivers directory contained up to 7 times more of
certain kinds of faults than other directories. This
result inspired numerous efforts on improving the
reliability of driver code. Today, Linux is used in
a wider range of environments, provides a wider
range of services, and has adopted a new development
and release model. What has been the impact of these
changes on code quality?

To answer this question, we have transported Chou et al.’s experiments
to all versions of Linux 2.6; released between 2003
and 2011. We find that Linux has more than doubled
in size during this period, but the number of faults
per line of code has been decreasing. Moreover, the
fault rate of drivers is now below that of other
directories, such as arch. These results can guide
further development and research efforts for the
decade to come. To allow updating these results as
Linux evolves, we define our experimental protocol
and make our checkers available.

Smart Home market players aim to deploy component-based and
service-oriented applications from untrusted third
party providers on a single OSGi execution
environment. This creates the risk of resource abuse
by buggy and malicious applications, which raises
the need for resource monitoring
mechanisms. Existing resource monitoring solutions
either are too intrusive or fail to identify the
relevant resource consumer in numerous multi-tenant
situations. This paper proposes a system to monitor
the memory consumed by each tenant, while allowing
them to continue communicating directly to render
services. We propose a solution based on a list of
configurable resource accounting rules between
tenants, which is far less intrusive than existing
OSGi monitoring systems. We modified an
experimental Java Virtual Machine in order to
provide the memory monitoring features for the
multi-tenant OSGi environment. Our evaluation of the
memory monitoring mechanism on the DaCapo
benchmarks shows an overhead below 46\%.

  abstract = {{Multi-tenancy is an approach to share one application instance among multiple customers by providing each of them a dedicated view. This approach is commonly used by SaaS providers to reduce the costs for service provisioning. Tenants also expect to be isolated in terms of the performance they observe and the providers inability to offer performance guarantees is a major obstacle for potential cloud customers. To guarantee an isolated performance it is essential to control the resources used by a tenant. This is a challenge, because the layers of the execution environment, responsible for controlling resource usage (e.g., operating system), normally do not have knowledge about entities defined at the application level and thus they cannot distinguish between different tenants. Furthermore, it is hard to predict how tenant requests propagate through the multiple layers of the execution environment down to the physical resource layer. The intended abstraction of the application from the resource controlling layers does not allow to solely solving this problem in the application. In this paper, we propose an approach which applies resource demand estimation techniques in combination with a request based admission control. The resource demand estimation is used to determine resource consumption information for individual requests. The admission control mechanism uses this knowledge to delay requests originating from tenants that exceed their allocated resource share. The proposed method is validated by a widely accepted benchmark showing its applicability in a setup motivated by today’s platform environments.}},

    abstract = {{Modern component frameworks support continuous deployment and simultaneous execution of multiple software components on top of the same virtual machine. However, isolation between the various components is limited. A faulty version of any one of the software components can compromise the whole system by consuming all available resources. In this paper, we address the problem of efficiently identifying faulty software components running simultaneously in a single virtual machine. Current solutions that perform permanent and extensive monitoring to detect anomalies induce high overhead on the system, and can, by themselves, make the system unstable. In this paper we present an optimistic adaptive monitoring system to determine the faulty components of an application. Suspected components are finely instrumented for deeper analysis by the monitoring system, but only when required. Unsuspected components are left untouched and execute normally. Thus, we perform localized just-in-time monitoring that decreases the accumulated overhead of the monitoring system. We evaluate our approach against a state-of-the-art monitoring system and show that our technique correctly detects faulty components, while reducing overhead by an average of 80\%.}},

@techreport{hewitt2010actor,
  abstract = {The Actor model is a mathematical theory that treats "Actors" as the
universal primitives of concurrent digital computation. The model has been used
both as a framework for a theoretical understanding of concurrency, and as the
theoretical basis for several practical implementations of concurrent systems.
Unlike previous models of computation, the Actor model was inspired by physical
laws. It was also influenced by the programming languages Lisp, Simula 67 and
Smalltalk-72, as well as ideas for Petri Nets, capability-based systems and
packet switching. The advent of massive concurrency through client-cloud
computing and many-core computer architectures has galvanized interest in the
Actor model.
  Actor technology will see significant application for integrating all kinds
of digital information for individuals, groups, and organizations so their
information usefully links together. Information integration needs to make use
of the following information system principles:
  * Persistence. Information is collected and indexed.
  * Concurrency: Work proceeds interactively and concurrently, overlapping in
time.
  * Quasi-commutativity: Information can be used regardless of whether it
initiates new work or become relevant to ongoing work.
  * Sponsorship: Sponsors provide resources for computation, i.e., processing,
storage, and communications.
  * Pluralism: Information is heterogeneous, overlapping and often
inconsistent.
  * Provenance: The provenance of information is carefully tracked and recorded
  The Actor Model is intended to provide a foundation for inconsistency robust
information integration},

    abstract = {{The Service Component Architecture (SCA) is a technology-independent standard for developing distributed Service-Oriented Architectures (SOA). The SCA standard promotes the use of components and architecture descriptors, and mostly covers the life-cycle steps of implementation and deployment. Unfortunately, SCA does not address the governance of SCA applications and provides no support for the maintenance of deployed components. This article covers this issue and introduces the FRASCATI platform, a run-time support for SCA with dynamic reconfiguration capabilities and run-time management features. The article presents the internal component-based architecture of the FRASCATI platform, and highlights its key features. The component-based design of the FRASCATI platform introduces many degrees of flexibility and configurability in the platform itself and for the SOA applications it can host. The article reports on micro-benchmarks highlighting that run-time manageability in the FRASCATI platform does not decrease its performance when compared to the de facto reference SCA implementation: Apache TUSCANY. Finally, a smart home scenario illustrates the extension capabilities and the various reconfigurations of the FRASCATI platform.}},

Besides requiring various areas of expertise, programming such applications involves writing a lot of administrative code to glue technologies together and to interface with both hardware and software components. This paper proposes a generative programming approach to providing programming, execution and simulation support dedicated to the pervasive computing domain. This approach relies on a domain-specific language, named DiaSpec, dedicated to the description of pervasive computing systems. Our generative approach factors out features of distributed systems technologies, making DiaSpec-specified software systems portable. The DiaSpec compiler is implemented and has been used to generate dedicated programming frameworks for a variety of pervasive computing applications, including detailed ones to manage the building of an engineering school.}},

    abstract = {{A software architecture describes the structure of a computing system by specifying software components and their interactions. Mapping a software architecture to an implementation is a well known challenge. A key element of this mapping is the architecture's description of the data and control-flow interactions between components. The characterization of these interactions can be rather abstract or very concrete, providing more or less implementation guidance, programming support, and static verification. In this paper, we explore one point in the design space between abstract and concrete component interaction specifications. We introduce a notion of behavioral contract that expresses the set of allowed interactions between components, describing both data and control-flow constraints. This declaration is part of the architecture description, allows generation of extensive programming support, and enables various verifications. We instantiate our approach in an architecture description language for the domain of Sense/Compute/Control applications, and describe associated compilation and verification strategies.}},

abstract={Components have long promised to encapsulate data and programs into a box that operates predictably without requiring that users know the specifics of how it does so. Many advocates have predicted that components will bring about widespread software reuse, spawning a market for components usable with such mainstream software buses as the Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) and the Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM). In the Windows world, at least, this prediction is becoming a reality. Yet recent reports indicate mixed results when using and reusing components in mission-critical settings. Such results raise disturbing questions. How can you trust a component? What if the component behaves unexpectedly, either because it is faulty or simply because you misused it? Before we can trust a component in mission-critical applications, we must be able to determine, reliably and in advance, how it will behave. In this article the authors define a general model of sofware contracts and show how existing mechanisms could be used to turn traditional components into contract-aware ones },

In this paper we present a connected home platform and development framework for easy design, development and deployment of smart home services offering a wealth of new exciting smart home experience on top of existing broadband service bundles. The home controller is used to integrate connectivity with home devices of various home control technologies. The service platform embeds the use of OSGi technology in the home controller that enables the OSGi-literate engineer to quickly develop and deploy home services utilising the widely adopted automation technologies. The different home network subsystems are interfaced in a common way through the Network Adaptation Layer, a set of OSGi components known as ROCob. Following the ROCob API Specification, a developer may build various applications, such as presentation layer applications (e.g. a Web based UI), monitoring applications that collect data and send them to a backbone server, and other home control and pervasive applications.},

That will bring the amazing possibility to control building facilities from any device with Internet access (PC, mobile phone, etc.). However, while it is already technically possible to connect devices directly to IP networks, most of home and building automation systems still use non-IP field level communication protocols. In this paper we describe an integration platform, which is an intermediate step between future IP based systems and available legacy equipment. The platform uses Web services technology for connecting devices to a stand-alone server. This approach makes the system flexible and independent from underlying platform and communication protocols. Conducted measurements with our oBIX based implementation show that our system model is efficient and can be deployed on cheap embedded devices with limited resources for computing.},

abstract={ This paper addresses the problem of selecting finite test sets and automating this selection. Among these methods, some are deterministic and some are statistical. The kind of statistical testing we consider has been inspired by the work of Thevenod-Fosse and Waeselynck. There, the choice of the distribution on the input domain is guided by the structure of the program or the form of its specification. In the present paper, we describe a new generic method for performing statistical testing according to any given graphical description of the behavior of the system under test. This method can be fully automated. Its main originality is that it exploits recent results and tools in combinatorics, precisely in the area of random generation of combinatorial structures. Uniform random generation routines are used for drawing paths from the set of execution paths or traces of the system under test. Then a constraint resolution step is performed, aiming to design a set of test data that activate the generated paths. This approach applies to a number of classical coverage criteria. Moreover, we show how linear programming techniques may help to improve the quality of test, i.e. the probabilities for the elements to be covered by the test process. The paper presents the method in its generality. Then, in the last section, experimental results on applying it to structural statistical software testing are reported.},

abstract={ Run-time service discovery and late-binding constitute some of the most challenging issues of service-oriented software engineering. For late-binding to be effective in the case of composite services, a QoS-aware composition mechanism is needed. This means determining the set of services that, once composed, not only will perform the required functionality, but also will best contribute to achieve the level of QoS promised in service level agreements (SLAs). However, QoS-aware composition relies on estimated QoS values and workflow execution paths previously obtained using a monitoring mechanism. At run-time, the actual QoS values may deviate from the estimations, or the execution path may not be the one foreseen. These changes could increase the risk of breaking SLAs and obtaining a poor QoS. Such a risk could be avoided by replanning the service bindings of the workflow slice still to be executed. This paper proposes an approach to trigger and perform composite service replanning during execution. An evaluation has been performed simulating execution and replanning on a set of composite service workflows.},

EMF provides facilities for building DSLs and tools based on a structured data model, with tight integration with the Eclipse IDE. EMF has rapidly become the defacto standard in the MDE community and has also been adopted for building Models@Runtime platforms. For example, Frascati (implementing the Service Component Architecture standard) uses EMF for the design and runtime tooling of its architecture description language. However, EMF has primarily been thought to support design-time activities. This paper highlights specific Models@Runtime requirements, discusses the bene- fits and limitations of EMF in this context, and presents an alternative implementation to meet these requirements.}},

We exploit the number of executed bytecode instructions as profiling metric, which has several advantages, such as making the instrumentation entirely portable and generating reproducible profiles. These ideas have been implemented as the \{JP\} tool. It provides a small and flexible \{API\} to write portable profiling agents in pure Java, which are periodically activated to process the collected profiling information. Performance measurements point out that \{JP\} causes significantly less overhead than a prevailing tool for the exact profiling of Java code. "
