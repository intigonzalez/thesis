This overhead makes instrumentation difficult to perform at runtime, often preventing many known offline feedback-directed optimizations from being used in online systems. This paper presents a general framework for performing instrumentation sampling to reduce the overhead of previously expensive instrumentation. The framework is simple and effective, using code-duplication and counter-based sampling...}},

  Abstract                 = {Components have long promised to encapsulate data and programs into a box that operates predictably without requiring that users know the specifics of how it does so. Many advocates have predicted that components will bring about widespread software reuse, spawning a market for components usable with such mainstream software buses as the Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) and the Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM). In the Windows world, at least, this prediction is becoming a reality. Yet recent reports indicate mixed results when using and reusing components in mission-critical settings. Such results raise disturbing questions. How can you trust a component? What if the component behaves unexpectedly, either because it is faulty or simply because you misused it? Before we can trust a component in mission-critical applications, we must be able to determine, reliably and in advance, how it will behave. In this article the authors define a general model of sofware contracts and show how existing mechanisms could be used to turn traditional components into contract-aware ones },

We exploit the number of executed bytecode instructions as profiling metric, which has several advantages, such as making the instrumentation entirely portable and generating reproducible profiles. These ideas have been implemented as the \{JP\} tool. It provides a small and flexible \{API\} to write portable profiling agents in pure Java, which are periodically activated to process the collected profiling information. Performance measurements point out that \{JP\} causes significantly less overhead than a prevailing tool for the exact profiling of Java code. },

Contemporary mission-critical software systems are often expected to safely adapt to changes in their execution environment. Given the critical roles these systems play, it is often inconvenient to take them offline to adapt their functionality. Consequently, these systems are required, when feasible, to adapt their behavior at runtime with little or no human intervention. A promising approach to managing complexity in runtime environments is to develop adaptation mechanisms that leverage software models, referred to as models@run. time. Work on models@run.time seeks to extend the applicability of models produced in model-driven engineering (MDE) approaches to the runtime environment. Models@run. time is a causally connected self-representation of the associated system that emphasizes the structure, behavior, or goals of the system from a problem space perspective.},

  Abstract                 = {Service-oriented architecture (SOA) is one of the prominent architectural paradigms recently adopted in the software development field. According to \{SOA\} principles, a distributed software system can be seen as an orchestration of software services deployed and executed onto networked hosts. The design-time analysis of SOA-based software systems demands new approaches that take into account both the inherent complexity and the architectural characteristics of such systems. In this respect, simulation-based approaches have proven to be effective to obtain quantitative predictions of system performance. Specifically, this chapter explains distributed simulation as a valuable technique to deal with the intrinsic distributed nature of SOA-based systems. Unfortunately, the adoption of distributed simulation requires a significant expertise and a considerable effort due to the complexity of currently available distributed simulation standards and technologies. This chapter introduces an automated method to reduce the effort and make distributed simulation easier to use. The method takes as input a design model of the SOA-based software system and yields as output the corresponding simulation model, ready to be deployed and transparently executed onto either a local or a distributed simulation engine. The design model is specified as a \{UML\} (Unified Modeling Language) model extended by use of the SoaML (Service-oriented architecture Modeling Language) profile, while the simulation model is specified in jEQN, a domain-specific language for the simulation of \{EQN\} (Extended Queueing Network) models. jEQN is part of SimArch, a layered architecture that eases the use of distributed simulation by hiding all the implementation details of the distributed execution platform. The proposed method is founded on the use of automated model transformations, with specific reference to standards and languages provided by the \{MDA\} (Model Driven Architecture). The joint use of automated model transformations and SimArch allows the user to effortlessly obtain, at design time, the performance-oriented distributed simulation model of the SOA-based system under development, thus giving system designers the ability to predict the performance behavior of the to-be system and/or to evaluate the impact on performance of different design alternatives. The chapter also presents an example application that shows how involved stakeholders can effectively benefit from the application of the proposed method. },

  Abstract                 = {During the last decade, researchers have proposed a number of model transformations enabling performance predictions. These transformations map performance-annotated software architecture models into stochastic models solved by analytical means or by simulation. However, so far, a detailed quantitative evaluation of the accuracy and efficiency of different transformations is missing, making it hard to select an adequate transformation for a given context. This paper provides an in-depth comparison and quantitative evaluation of representative model transformations to, e.g., Queueing Petri Nets and Layered Queueing Networks. The semantic gaps between typical source model abstractions and the different analysis techniques are revealed. The accuracy and efficiency of each transformation are evaluated by considering four case studies representing systems of different size and complexity. The presented results and insights gained from the evaluation help software architects and performance engineers to select the appropriate transformation for a given context, thus significantly improving the usability of model transformations for performance prediction.},

  Abstract                 = {Component-based software engineering is a powerful paradigm for building large applications. However, our experience with building application of components is that the existing advanced component models (such as those offering component nesting, behavior specification and checking, dynamic reconfiguration to some extent, etc.) are subject to a lot of limitations and issues which prevent them from being accepted more widely (by industry in particular). We claim that these issues are specifically related to (a) the lack of support for dynamic reconfigurations of hierarchical architectures, (b) poor support for modeling and extendibility of the control part of a component, and (c) the lack of support for different communication styles applied in inter-component communication. In this paper, we show how these problems can be addressed and present an advanced component system SOFA 2.0 as a proof of the concept. This system is based on its predecessor SOFA, but it incorporates a number of enhancements and improvements},

  Abstract                 = { Run-time service discovery and late-binding constitute some of the most challenging issues of service-oriented software engineering. For late-binding to be effective in the case of composite services, a QoS-aware composition mechanism is needed. This means determining the set of services that, once composed, not only will perform the required functionality, but also will best contribute to achieve the level of QoS promised in service level agreements (SLAs). However, QoS-aware composition relies on estimated QoS values and workflow execution paths previously obtained using a monitoring mechanism. At run-time, the actual QoS values may deviate from the estimations, or the execution path may not be the one foreseen. These changes could increase the risk of breaking SLAs and obtaining a poor QoS. Such a risk could be avoided by replanning the service bindings of the workflow slice still to be executed. This paper proposes an approach to trigger and perform composite service replanning during execution. An evaluation has been performed simulating execution and replanning on a set of composite service workflows.},

An essential dimension is time, since many embedded systems have real-time requirements. We define a formal semantics of a component language for embedded systems, SaveCCM, a language designed with vehicle applications and safety concerns in focus. The semantics is defined by a transformation into timed automata with tasks, a formalism that explicitly models timing and real-time task scheduling. A simple SaveCCM system with a \{PI\} controller is used as a case study. Temporal properties of the \{PI\} controller have been successfully verified using the timed automata model checker Uppaal. },

  Abstract                 = {
 In the last few years, managed runtime environments such as the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) are increasingly used on large-scale multicore servers. The garbage collector (GC) represents a critical component of the JVM and has a significant influence on the overall performance and efficiency of the running application. We perform a study on all available Java GCs, both in an academic environment (set of benchmarks), as well as in a simulated real-life situation (client-server application). We mainly focus on the three most widely used collectors: ParallelOld, ConcurrentMarkSweep and G1. We find that they exhibit different behaviours in the two tested environments. In particular, the default Java GC, ParallelOld, proves to be stable and adequate in the first situation, while in the real-life scenario its use results in unacceptable pauses for the application threads. We believe that this is partly due to the memory requirements of the multicore server. G1 GC performs notably bad on the benchmarks when forced to have a full collection between the iterations of the application. Moreover, even though G1 and ConcurrentMarkSweep GCs introduce significantly lower pauses than ParallelOld in the client-server environment, they can still seriously impact the response time on the client. Pauses of around 3 seconds can make a real-time system unusable and may disrupt the communication between nodes in the case of large-scale distributed systems.

  Abstract                 = {{A software architecture describes the structure of a computing system by specifying software components and their interactions. Mapping a software architecture to an implementation is a well known challenge. A key element of this mapping is the architecture's description of the data and control-flow interactions between components. The characterization of these interactions can be rather abstract or very concrete, providing more or less implementation guidance, programming support, and static verification. In this paper, we explore one point in the design space between abstract and concrete component interaction specifications. We introduce a notion of behavioral contract that expresses the set of allowed interactions between components, describing both data and control-flow constraints. This declaration is part of the architecture description, allows generation of extensive programming support, and enables various verifications. We instantiate our approach in an architecture description language for the domain of Sense/Compute/Control applications, and describe associated compilation and verification strategies.}},

Besides requiring various areas of expertise, programming such applications involves writing a lot of administrative code to glue technologies together and to interface with both hardware and software components. This paper proposes a generative programming approach to providing programming, execution and simulation support dedicated to the pervasive computing domain. This approach relies on a domain-specific language, named DiaSpec, dedicated to the description of pervasive computing systems. Our generative approach factors out features of distributed systems technologies, making DiaSpec-specified software systems portable. The DiaSpec compiler is implemented and has been used to generate dedicated programming frameworks for a variety of pervasive computing applications, including detailed ones to manage the building of an engineering school.}},

  Abstract                 = {In the last decade, a large number of different software component models have been developed, with different aims and using different principles and technologies. This has resulted in a number of models which have many similarities, but also principal differences, and in many cases unclear concepts. Component-based development has not succeeded in providing standard principles, as has, for example, object-oriented development. In order to increase the understanding of the concepts and to differentiate component models more easily, this paper identifies, discusses, and characterizes fundamental principles of component models and provides a Component Model Classification Framework based on these principles. Further, the paper classifies a large number of component models using this framework.},

  Abstract                 = {
Today, Java is regularly used to implement large multi-threaded
server-class applications that use locks to protect access to shared data. However, understanding the
impact of locks on the performance of a system is complex, and thus the use of locks can impede the
progress of threads on configurations that were not anticipated by the developer, during specific
phases of the execution. In this paper, we propose Free Lunch, a new lock profiler for Java application
servers, specifically designed to identify, in-vivo, phases where the progress of the threads is impeded
by a lock. Free Lunch is designed around a new metric, critical section pressure (CSP), which
directly correlates the progress of the threads to each of the locks. Using Free Lunch, we have
identified phases of high CSP, which were hidden with other lock profilers, in the distributed
Cassandra NoSQL database and in several applications from the DaCapo 9.12, the SPECjvm2008 and the
SPECjbb2005 benchmark suites. Our evaluation of Free Lunch shows that its overhead is never greater
than 6\%, making it suitable for in-vivo use.

  Abstract                 = { This paper addresses the problem of selecting finite test sets and automating this selection. Among these methods, some are deterministic and some are statistical. The kind of statistical testing we consider has been inspired by the work of Thevenod-Fosse and Waeselynck. There, the choice of the distribution on the input domain is guided by the structure of the program or the form of its specification. In the present paper, we describe a new generic method for performing statistical testing according to any given graphical description of the behavior of the system under test. This method can be fully automated. Its main originality is that it exploits recent results and tools in combinatorics, precisely in the area of random generation of combinatorial structures. Uniform random generation routines are used for drawing paths from the set of execution paths or traces of the system under test. Then a constraint resolution step is performed, aiming to design a set of test data that activate the generated paths. This approach applies to a number of classical coverage criteria. Moreover, we show how linear programming techniques may help to improve the quality of test, i.e. the probabilities for the elements to be covered by the test process. The paper presents the method in its generality. Then, in the last section, experimental results on applying it to structural statistical software testing are reported.},

  Abstract                 = {{Models@Runtime aims at taming the complexity of software dynamic adaptation by pushing further the idea of reflection and con- sidering the reflection layer as a first-class modeling space. A natural approach to Models@Runtime is to use MDE techniques, in particular those based on the Eclipse Modeling Framework. EMF provides facilities for building DSLs and tools based on a structured data model, with tight integration with the Eclipse IDE. EMF has rapidly become the defacto standard in the MDE community and has also been adopted for building Models@Runtime platforms. For example, Frascati (implementing the Service Component Architecture standard) uses EMF for the design and runtime tooling of its architecture description language. However, EMF has primarily been thought to support design-time activities. This paper highlights specific Models@Runtime requirements, discusses the bene- fits and limitations of EMF in this context, and presents an alternative implementation to meet these requirements.}},

  Abstract                 = {
The OSGi framework is a Java-based, centralized, component oriented
platform. It is being widely adopted as an execution environment for
the development of extensible applications. However, current Java
Virtual Machines are unable to isolate components from each other. For
instance, a malicious component can freeze the complete platform by
allocating too much memory or alter the behavior of other components
by modifying shared variables. This paper presents I-JVM, a Java
Virtual Machine that provides a lightweight approach to isolation
while preserving compatibility with legacy OSGi applications. Our
evaluation of I-JVM shows that it solves the 8 known OSGi
vulnerabilities that are due to the Java Virtual Machine and that the
overhead of I-JVM compared to the JVM on which it is based is below
20\%.

  Abstract                 = {
 On contemporary cache-coherent Non-Uniform Memory Access
 (ccNUMA) architectures, applications with a large memory footprint
 suffer from the cost of the garbage collector (GC), because,
 as the GC scans the reference graph, it makes many remote memory
 accesses, saturating the interconnect between memory nodes.
 We address this problem with NumaGiC, a GC with a
 mostly-distributed design.
 In order to maximise memory access locality during collection, a GC
 thread avoids accessing a different memory node, instead notifying a
 remote GC thread with a message; nonetheless, NumaGiC avoids the
 drawbacks of a pure distributed design, which tends to decrease
 parallelism.
 We compare NumaGiC with Parallel Scavenge and NAPS
 on two different ccNUMA architectures running on the Hotspot Java Virtual Machine of OpenJDK 7.
 On Spark and Neo4j, two industry-strength analytics applications,
 with heap sizes ranging from 160\,GB to 350\,GB, and on
 SPECjbb2013 and SPECjbb2005, NumaGiC improves
 overall performance by up to 45\% over NAPS
 (up to 94\% over Parallel Scavenge),
 and increases the performance of
 the collector itself by up to 3.6$\times$ over NAPS
 (up to 5.4$\times$ over Parallel Scavenge).

However, isolation between the various components is limited. A faulty version of any one of the software components can compromise the whole system by consuming all available resources. In this paper, we address the problem of efficiently identifying faulty software components running simultaneously in a single virtual machine. Current solutions that perform permanent and extensive monitoring to detect anomalies induce high overhead on the system, and can, by themselves, make the system unstable. In this paper we present an optimistic adaptive monitoring system to determine the faulty components of an application. Suspected components are finely instrumented for deeper analysis by the monitoring system, but only when required. Unsuspected components are left untouched and execute normally. Thus, we perform localized just-in-time monitoring that decreases the accumulated overhead of the monitoring system. We evaluate our approach against a state-of-the-art monitoring system and show that our technique correctly detects faulty components, while reducing overhead by an average of 80\%.}},

  Abstract                 = {Model-driven design (MDD) aims at elevating design to a higher level of abstraction than that provided by third-generation programming languages. Concurrently, assertion-based verification (ABV) relies on the definition of temporal assertions to enhance functional verification targeting the correctness of the design execution with respect to the expected behavior. Both \{MDD\} and \{ABV\} have affirmed as effective methodologies for design and verification of \{HW\} components of embedded systems. Nonetheless, \{MDD\} and \{ABV\} individually suffer some limitations that prevent their integration in the embedded-software (ESW) design and verification flow. In particular, \{MDD\} requires the integration of an effective methodology for monitoring specification conformance, and dynamic \{ABV\} relies on simulation assumptions, satisfied in the \{HW\} domain, but which cannot be straightforward guaranteed during the execution of ESW. In this work, we present a suitable combination of \{MDD\} and dynamic \{ABV\} as an effective solution for \{ESW\} design and verification. A suite composed of two off-the-shelf tools has been developed for supporting this integrated approach. The \{MDD\} tool, i.e., radCASE, is a rapid-application-development environment for \{ESW\} that provides the user with a comprehensive approach to cover the complete modeling and synthesis process of ESW. The dynamic \{ABV\} environment, i.e., radCHECK, integrates computer-aided and template-based assertion definition, automatic checker generation, and effective stimuli generation, making dynamic \{ABV\} really practical to check the correctness of the radCASE outcome. },

Thus, these test cases are frequently designed from the different scenarios and alternatives depicted in functional requirements. The objective of this paper is to introduce a systematic process based on the Model-Driven paradigm to automate the generation of functional test cases from functional requirements. For this aim, a set of metamodels and transformations and also a specific language domain to use them is presented. The paper finishes stating learned lessons from the trenches as well as relevant future work and conclusions that draw new research lines in the test cases generation context. },

  Abstract                 = {We propose a new development scheme for quality-aware applications, quality-driven development (QDD), based on the Model-Driven Architecture (MDA) of Object Management Group OMG. We argue that software development in areas, such as real-time systems, should not only rely on code verification, but also on design verification, and show that a slightly extended \{MDA\} process offers the opportunity to integrate system development together with design verification. As an instance of the method, we present the MDA-based tool environment of the \{HIDOORS\} project [Karlsruhe James Hunt. Forschungszentrum Informatik. High-integrity distributed object- oriented real-time systems. http://www.hidoors.org]. In this environment, a real-time model checker is interpreted as a platform in the sense of MDA. \{UML\} designs can be annotated with verification markup, which is not only compiled to code, but also to a design verification model of the verification platform, the model-checker. In this way, model-checking for real-time designs is integrated into the model-driven development process and allows for early verification. The approach can easily be transfered to other verification techniques. We give a preliminary classification of the possible verification platforms and analyse their interplay. The analysis reveals that for quality-aware application areas, the standard \{MDA\} approach should be extended by one or more \{MDA\} stacks for model-driven verification (MDV). The resulting approach, quality-driven development (QDD), is, to our knowledge, the first systematic approach to integrate code generation and verification in model-driven development. },

  Abstract                 = {The Actor model is a mathematical theory that treats "Actors" as the
universal primitives of concurrent digital computation. The model has been used
both as a framework for a theoretical understanding of concurrency, and as the
theoretical basis for several practical implementations of concurrent systems.
Unlike previous models of computation, the Actor model was inspired by physical
laws. It was also influenced by the programming languages Lisp, Simula 67 and
Smalltalk-72, as well as ideas for Petri Nets, capability-based systems and
packet switching. The advent of massive concurrency through client-cloud
computing and many-core computer architectures has galvanized interest in the
Actor model.
 Actor technology will see significant application for integrating all kinds
of digital information for individuals, groups, and organizations so their
information usefully links together. Information integration needs to make use
of the following information system principles:
 * Persistence. Information is collected and indexed.
 * Concurrency: Work proceeds interactively and concurrently, overlapping in
time.
 * Quasi-commutativity: Information can be used regardless of whether it
initiates new work or become relevant to ongoing work.
 * Sponsorship: Sponsors provide resources for computation, i.e., processing,
storage, and communications.
 * Pluralism: Information is heterogeneous, overlapping and often
inconsistent.
 * Provenance: The provenance of information is carefully tracked and recorded
 The Actor Model is intended to provide a foundation for inconsistency robust
information integration},

  Abstract                 = {EarlGray is a component-based Java virtual machine (JVM) that can be configured to satisfy various kinds of requirements for building future information appliances and embedded systems. While the modification and extension on an existing JVM tend to be done in an ad-hoc manner, EarlGray allows developers to customize the JVM in a systematic manner by decomposing it into components and the explicit descriptions of the relationship between the components. We also examine three case studies on the customization of the EarlGray: exchanging a scheduler, memory management, and class file verifier components. These case studies show the benefits and drawbacks of the current component-based technologies.},

  Abstract                 = {In future buildings, all devices will be connected directly to the Internet, surrounding people with a Web of Things. That will bring the amazing possibility to control building facilities from any device with Internet access (PC, mobile phone, etc.). However, while it is already technically possible to connect devices directly to IP networks, most of home and building automation systems still use non-IP field level communication protocols. In this paper we describe an integration platform, which is an intermediate step between future IP based systems and available legacy equipment. The platform uses Web services technology for connecting devices to a stand-alone server. This approach makes the system flexible and independent from underlying platform and communication protocols. Conducted measurements with our oBIX based implementation show that our system model is efficient and can be deployed on cheap embedded devices with limited resources for computing.},

  Abstract                 = {{Multi-tenancy is an approach to share one application instance among multiple customers by providing each of them a dedicated view. This approach is commonly used by SaaS providers to reduce the costs for service provisioning. Tenants also expect to be isolated in terms of the performance they observe and the providers inability to offer performance guarantees is a major obstacle for potential cloud customers. To guarantee an isolated performance it is essential to control the resources used by a tenant. This is a challenge, because the layers of the execution environment, responsible for controlling resource usage (e.g., operating system), normally do not have knowledge about entities defined at the application level and thus they cannot distinguish between different tenants. Furthermore, it is hard to predict how tenant requests propagate through the multiple layers of the execution environment down to the physical resource layer. The intended abstraction of the application from the resource controlling layers does not allow to solely solving this problem in the application. In this paper, we propose an approach which applies resource demand estimation techniques in combination with a request based admission control. The resource demand estimation is used to determine resource consumption information for individual requests. The admission control mechanism uses this knowledge to delay requests originating from tenants that exceed their allocated resource share. The proposed method is validated by a widely accepted benchmark showing its applicability in a setup motivated by today’s platform environments.}},

As JMX is increasingly accepted into the fields of embedded systems, enterprise systems, and telephony, it is clear that all Java developers will encounter JMX before long. Java and JMX: Building Manageable Systems is the definitive guide to JMX, combining an introduction to the technology with extensive coverage that will make this book a favorite reference. Much more than just an explanation of the JMX specifications, this book can drastically reduce a reader's JMX learning curve by explaining how to develop management requirements and apply JMX to them.},

  Abstract                 = {The accurate measurement of the execution time of Java bytecode is one factor that is important in order to estimate the total execution time of a Java application running on a Java Virtual Machine. In this paper we document the difficulties and solutions for the accurate timing of Java bytecode. We also identify trends across the execution times recorded for all imperative Java bytecodes. These trends would suggest that knowing the execution times of a small subset of the Java bytecode instructions would be sufficient to model the execution times of the remainder. We first review a statistical approach for achieving high precision timing results for Java bytecode using low precision timers and then present a more suitable technique using homogeneous bytecode sequences for recording such information. We finally compare instruction execution times acquired using this platform independent technique against execution times recorded using the read time stamp counter assembly instruction. In particular our results show the existence of a strong linear correlation between both techniques. },

  Abstract                 = {This paper introduces a novel method and a prototype tool for the resource monitoring of OSGi-based software components. The OSGi Service Platform enables the cooperation of multiple Java based components within a single Java Virtual Machine (JVM), introducing challenges for resource monitoring as the JVM conceals the resource consumption information of separate OSGi components. When addressing this challenge as a research problem, a method based on arranging execution threads of components to separate groups is presented. The presented method and prototype tool enable the identification of the resource consumption of individual accountable components executed within a single JVM. The prototype monitoring tool is used for validating the presented resource monitoring method and is also overviewed in this paper, providing an insight view to the JVM from a resource consumption perspective.},

  Abstract                 = {{Most consumer electronics today contain embedded software. In the early days, developing CE software presented relatively minor challenges, but in the past several years three significant problems have arisen: size and complexity of the software in individual products; the increasing diversity of products and their software; and the need for decreased development time.The question of handling diversity and complexity in embedded software at an increasing production speed becomes an urgent one. The authors present their belief that the answer lies not in hiring more software engineers. They are not readily available, and even if they were, experience shows that larger projects induce larger lead times and often result in greater complexity. Instead, they believe that the answer lies in the use and reuse of software components that work within an explicit software architecture.The Koala model, a component-oriented approach detailed in this article, is their way of handling the diversity of software in consumer electronics. Used for embedded software in TV sets, it allows late binding of reusable components with no additional overhead.}},

  Abstract                 = { 
In August 2011, Linux entered its third decade. Ten years before, Chou
et al. published a study of faults found by applying
a static analyzer to Linux versions 1.0 through
2.4.1. A major result of their work was that the
drivers directory contained up to 7 times more of
certain kinds of faults than other directories. This
result inspired numerous efforts on improving the
reliability of driver code. Today, Linux is used in
a wider range of environments, provides a wider
range of services, and has adopted a new development
and release model. What has been the impact of these
changes on code quality?

To answer this question, we have transported Chou et al.’s experiments
to all versions of Linux 2.6; released between 2003
and 2011. We find that Linux has more than doubled
in size during this period, but the number of faults
per line of code has been decreasing. Moreover, the
fault rate of drivers is now below that of other
directories, such as arch. These results can guide
further development and research efforts for the
decade to come. To allow updating these results as
Linux evolves, we define our experimental protocol
and make our checkers available.

  Abstract                 = {Smart home automation technologies have been commercially available already, however the interoperability problems of different hardware and software components, the limited service scalability and the complexity of configuration and use prevent their mass adoption. In this paper we present a connected home platform and development framework for easy design, development and deployment of smart home services offering a wealth of new exciting smart home experience on top of existing broadband service bundles. The home controller is used to integrate connectivity with home devices of various home control technologies. The service platform embeds the use of OSGi technology in the home controller that enables the OSGi-literate engineer to quickly develop and deploy home services utilising the widely adopted automation technologies. The different home network subsystems are interfaced in a common way through the Network Adaptation Layer, a set of OSGi components known as ROCob. Following the ROCob API Specification, a developer may build various applications, such as presentation layer applications (e.g. a Web based UI), monitoring applications that collect data and send them to a backbone server, and other home control and pervasive applications.},

  Abstract                 = {Calling context profiling collects statistics separately for each calling context. Complete calling context profiles that faithfully represent overall program execution are important for a sound analysis of program behavior, which in turn is important for program understanding, reverse engineering, and workload characterization. Many existing calling context profilers for Java rely on sampling or on incomplete instrumentation techniques, yielding incomplete profiles; others rely on Java Virtual Machine (JVM) modifications or work only with one specific JVM, thus compromising portability. In this paper we present a new calling context profiler for Java that reconciles completeness of the collected profiles and full compatibility with any standard JVM. In order to reduce measurement perturbation, our profiler collects platform-independent dynamic metrics, such as the number of method invocations and the number of executed bytecodes. In contrast to prevailing calling context profilers, our tool is able to distinguish between multiple call sites in a method and supports selective profiling of (the dynamic extent of) certain methods. We have evaluate the overhead introduced by our profiler with standard Java and Scala benchmarks on a range of different JVMs. },

  Abstract                 = {{The Service Component Architecture (SCA) is a technology-independent standard for developing distributed Service-Oriented Architectures (SOA). The SCA standard promotes the use of components and architecture descriptors, and mostly covers the life-cycle steps of implementation and deployment. Unfortunately, SCA does not address the governance of SCA applications and provides no support for the maintenance of deployed components. This article covers this issue and introduces the FRASCATI platform, a run-time support for SCA with dynamic reconfiguration capabilities and run-time management features. The article presents the internal component-based architecture of the FRASCATI platform, and highlights its key features. The component-based design of the FRASCATI platform introduces many degrees of flexibility and configurability in the platform itself and for the SOA applications it can host. The article reports on micro-benchmarks highlighting that run-time manageability in the FRASCATI platform does not decrease its performance when compared to the de facto reference SCA implementation: Apache TUSCANY. Finally, a smart home scenario illustrates the extension capabilities and the various reconfigurations of the FRASCATI platform.}},

A new study that surveyed 450 MDE practitioners and performed in-depth interviews with 22 more suggests that although MDE might be more widespread than commonly believed, developers rarely use it to generate whole systems. Rather, they apply MDE to develop key parts of a system.},
