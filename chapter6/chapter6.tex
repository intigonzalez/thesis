%#Context  
%Domain-specific abstractions are increasingly used in industry to ease the development of applications. These abstractions take various forms, (e.g., domain-specific languages (DSL), macros, component models). Workbenches exist to define tooling over such abstractions. For example, DSL workbenches support the development of editors and code generators. 
% #Problem 
%However, profiling applications which use these abstractions requires significant development efforts to keep the traceability links between these abstractions and the runtime data-structures. This effort must be balanced with the limited audience of these abstractions. 
%Sate of the art profilers are able to represent such abstractions through generic query evaluation, but they suffer from bad performance issue. 

%#Contribution
%In this paper, we propose an approach to ease the development of efficient memory analysis tools to be used during the production stage.
%Our approach provides a DSL to express the mapping between abstractions and runtime data structure.
%At runtime, the generated  memory analysis tools leverage the object graph traversal mechanism to efficiently collect the specific memory data required.
%#Evaluation
%To evaluate our approach, we compare memory analysis tools produced with our DSL against: i) hand written optimized solutions, and ii) solutions based on existing tools which offer lower performance.
%The results show that our approach offers performance gain compared to previous solutions, and simplify the definition of memory analysis tools.

\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusions}

In this chapter, we propose a Domain Specific Language for expressing the mapping between abstractions and runtime data structure to collect information about the memory heap in production.
This language provides an abstraction that is useful to reason about the heap and is, at the same time, easy to translate into a set of low-level routines to efficiently collect the desired information.
In our opinion, this approach is a step forward in the creation of resource-aware software systems for two reasons. 
First, it reduces the complexity of defining customized queries; hence, developers and operators are able to use this feature to solve new problems without the need of high expertise on runtime internals.
Second, such customized queries can be used in a production environment since they have a limited impact on the system's performance.

The approach proposed in this chapter contributes to answer a research questions presented in the introduction of this thesis (see Section \ref{sec:intro-challenges}).
In particular, it answers \textit{RQ4} (\textit{How can we ease the definition and implementation of monitoring tools for new software abstractions?}) by defining a metalanguage to describe the behavior of customized memory profilers.
These profilers are useful to calculate at runtime how components and other domain-specific abstractions consume resources.
